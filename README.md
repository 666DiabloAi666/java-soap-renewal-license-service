🛂 java-soap-renewal-license-service

📜 Overview

The java-soap-renewal-license-service is a biometric-enhanced SOAP web service designed to handle secure Driver's License Renewal Requests, incorporating multi-factor identity logic, digital signature validation, AGI-authenticated downlink responses, and optional integration with national biometric ID registries.

Designed for government-grade deployments, this service is optimized for e-Gov, DMV, and public infrastructure systems. The service allows clients (web portals, mobile apps, or kiosk interfaces) to request, validate, and renew driver’s licenses securely over a Java SOAP interface.
